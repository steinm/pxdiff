What is pxdiff ?
----------------

pxdiff is a command line program which compares two paradox databases
and outputs the difference. It can both find differences in the table
structure and the data records. Records are always treated as a single
unit. Differences within records will not be reported.

For a more detailed documentation read the man page pxdiff(1) and
check the web site at http://pxlib.sourceforge.net.
